TestCast
========

TestCast is a spike.
No tests, the code is ugly, and not production.

The idea, however, is simple; instead of doing laborious screencasts, why not run your automated scenario based /
acceptance tests in play mode (fast, and for CI) or record mode?

I've still to write a test runner for JUnit to pack this up neatly. Look at the principles in the RecordScreen class.
